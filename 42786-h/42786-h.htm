<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>JACOB GRIMM ON THE GENIUS AND VOCATION OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</h3>

  <p>I send you a very eloquent tribute to the genius and power of the
  English language by Jacob Grimm, extracted from a paper entitled "Ueber
  den Ursprung der Sprache," read before the Royal Academy of Berlin,
  January 9, 1851, and contained in the <i>Transactions</i> of that
  Society, "Section of Philology and History for 1851," p. 135.: Berlin,
  4to., 1852:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Jacob Grimm <i>Ueber den Ursprung der Sprache</i>. Abhandlungen der
  K. Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, 1851.</p>

  <p>"Keine, unter allen neueren Sprachen, hat gerade durch das Aufgeben
  und Zerrütten alter Lautgesetze, durch den Wegfall beinahe sämmtlicher
  Flexionen, eine grössere Kraft und Stärke empfangen, als die Englische,
  und von ihrer nicht einmal <i>lehrbaren</i>, nur <i>lernbaren</i> Fülle
  freier Mitteltöne ist eine wesentliche Gewalt des Ausdrucks abhängig
  geworden, wie sie vielleicht noch nie einer andern menschlichen Zunge zu
  Gebote stand. Ihre ganze überaus geistige, wunderbar geglückte Anlage und
  Durchbildung war hervorgeganen aus einer überraschenden Vermählung der
  beiden edelsten Sprachen des späteren Europas, der Germanischen und
  Romanischen, und bekannt ist, wie im Englischen sich beide zu einander
  verhalten, indem jene bei weitem die sinnliche Grundlage hergab, diese
  die geistigen Begriffe zuführte. Ja, die Englische Sprache, von der nicht
  umsonst auch der grösste und überlegenste Dichter der neuen Zeit im
  Gegensatz zur classischen alten Poesie, ich kann natürlich nur
  Shakespeare meinen, gezeugt und getragen worden ist, sie darf mit vollem
  Recht eine Weltsprache heissen, und scheint gleich dem Englischen Volke
  ausersehn künftig noch in höherem Masse an allen Enden der Erde zu
  walten. Denn an Reichthum, Vernunft und gedrängter Füge lässt sich keine
  aller noch lebenden Sprachen ihr an die Seite setzen, auch unsere
  Deutsche nicht, die zerrissen ist, wie wir selbst zerrissen sind, und
  erst manche Gebrechen von sich abschütteln müsste, ehe sie kühn mit in
  die Laufbahn träte."</p>

<p class="ac">(<i>Translation.</i>)</p>

  <p>Of all modern languages, not one has acquired such great strength and
  vigour as the English. It has accomplished this by simply freeing itself
  from the ancient phonetic laws, and casting off almost all <!-- Page 126
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>{126}</span>inflections;
  whilst, from its abundance of intermediate sounds [<i>Mitteltöne</i><a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>], tones not even
  to be taught, but only to be learned, it has derived a characteristic
  power of expression such as perhaps was never yet the property of any
  other human tongue. Its highly spiritual genius, and wonderfully happy
  development, have proceeded from a surprisingly intimate alliance of the
  two oldest languages of modern Europe&mdash;the Germanic and
  Romanesque.<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> It
  is well known in what relation these stand to one another in the English
  language. The former supplies the material groundwork, the latter the
  higher mental conceptions. Indeed, the English language, which has not in
  vain produced and supported the greatest, the most prominent of all
  modern poets (I allude, of course, to Shakspeare), in contradistinction
  to the ancient classical poetry, may be called justly a <span
  class="sm">LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD</span>: and seems, like the English
  nation, to be destined to reign in future with still more extensive sway
  over all parts of the globe. For none of all the living languages can be
  compared with it as to richness, rationality, and close construction
  [Vernunft und gedrängter Füge], not even the German&mdash;which has many
  discrepancies like our nation, and from which it would be first obliged
  to free itself, before it could boldly enter the lists with the
  English.</p>

  <p>I transmit the text, as many of your readers may prefer the
  extract&mdash;as most "foreign extracts" are preferred&mdash;"neat as
  imported:" although, owing to the kindness of a friend, it is fairly
  represented in the translation. It is however very difficult to find
  words which precisely express the meaning of German scientific terms.</p>

<h3>PRESERVATION OF VALUABLE PAPERS FROM DAMP; DRYING CLOSETS.</h3>

  <p>The desiccative powers of lime are familiar to chemists, and, I
  believe, to many practical men; but I do not know of lime having been
  used for the above purpose.</p>

  <p>A strong chest, in my possession, containing important papers
  (title-deeds, marriage certificates, &amp;c.), gradually became damp, and
  subjected its contents to a slow process of decay. This arose, I found,
  from a defect in its construction, wood having been improperly introduced
  into the latter, and concealed; so that some singular chemical compounds
  would appear to have been formed. The papers were gradually injured to an
  extent enforcing attention; and the process continued in them after their
  removal into a well-constructed chest, giving me the impression of a
  process resembling the action of a ferment. Several attempts were made to
  dry them by fires, the rays of the sun, &amp;c.; but the damp was always
  renewed.</p>

  <p>They were thoroughly dried in a very few days, and permanently kept
  dry, by placing and keeping in the chest a box containing a little
  quicklime.</p>

  <p>At a later period, a large closet, so damp as to render articles
  mouldy, was thoroughly dried, and kept dry, by a box containing lime.</p>

  <p>The chest was about 2 feet 6 inches, by 2 feet 1 inch, and 1 foot 8
  inches; and the box placed in it for several months was about 1 foot 2½
  inches, by 8½ inches, and 3 inches. After about a year, although no very
  perceptible damp was discovered, yet, in consequence of the value of the
  papers, and the beauty of some of them as manuscripts, I introduced two
  such boxes. These proportions were selected to enable the boxes to stand
  conveniently on a shelf with account-books and packages of papers.</p>

  <p>The closet is about 11 feet 4 inches, by 2, irregular dimensions,
  which I estimate at about 6 feet, and 2 feet 4 inches. The box used in
  this case is 1 foot 4 inches, by 11 inches, and 7 inches.</p>

  <p>The lime should be in pieces of a suitable size. For the chest, I
  prefer pieces about the size of a large English walnut; for the closet,
  of an orange.</p>

  <p>It is necessary either that the box should be strongly made, or be
  formed of tin, or other metal, on account of the lateral expansive force
  of the lime. Room for expansion upwards is not sufficient protection. The
  same expansion renders it necessary that the box should not be more than
  two-fifths filled with fresh lime.</p>

  <p>I leave the tops open. If covered, they must be so disposed that the
  air within the boxes shall freely communicate with that of the chest or
  closet.</p>

  <p>I have used these boxes several years, and only changed the lime once
  a year.</p>

<h3>POSITION OF THE CLERGY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

  <p>The <i>Proceedings and Papers</i> of the Historic Society of
  Lancashire and Cheshire, Session IV., 1851-2, include a paper contributed
  by Thomas Dorning Hibbert, of the Middle Temple, Esq., being the second
  of a series of "Letters relating to Lancashire and Cheshire, temp. James
  I., Charles I., and Charles II."</p>

  <p>One of these letters, written in or about the year 1605, by the Rev.
  William Batemanne, from Ludgarsall (Ludgar's Hall), "a parish which lies
  in the counties of Oxford and Bucks," and addressed "to his louinge
  father Ihon Batemanne, alderman at Maxfelde" (Macclesfield), contains, as
  the learned contributor remarks, "strong confirmation of Mr. Macaulay's
  controverted statement, that the country clergy occupied a very humble
  position in the sixteenth and seventeenth <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span>centuries." He adds,
  that "no clergyman could now be found who would think of sending his
  sister to an inn to learn household matters."</p>

  <p>The Rev. William Batemanne, "who appears to have been educated at
  Oxford," writes thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"... My sister Katren is placed in a verie good house in Bissiter
  [Bicester], wher shea shall learne to doe all manner of thinges that
  belonge to a good huswyfe. It is a vitailinge house greatlie occupied.
  Shea shall not learne onelie to dresse meate and drinke excellent well,
  but allso bruinge, bakinge, winnowinge, with all other thinges theirunto
  appertaininge, for they are verie rich folkes, and verie sharpe and
  quicke both of them. The cause why my Ant received her not, as shea
  answered us, was because all this winter shea intendeth to have but one
  servant woman, and shea thought my sister was not able to doe all her
  worke, because shea imagined her to be verie raw in theire countrey
  worke, w<sup>ch</sup> thinge trewlie shea that hath her now did thinke,
  and theirefore her wage is the slenderer, but xvj<sup>s</sup>
  [16<i>s.</i>], w<sup>ch</sup> in this place is counted nothinge in
  effecte for such a strong woman as shea is; but I bringinge her to
  Bissiter uppon Wednesday, beinng Michaelmas even, told her dame the wage
  was verie small, and said I trusted shea would mend it if shea proved a
  good girle, as I had good hope shea would. Quoth I, it will scarce bye
  her hose and shooes. Nay, saith shea, I will warrant her have so much
  given her before the yeare be expyred, and by God's helpe that
  w<sup>ch</sup> wants I myselfe will fill upp as much as I am
  able...."</p>

<h3>GENERAL WOLFE.</h3>

  <p>I copy the following interesting Note from the <i>London
  Chronicle</i>, August 19, 1788:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>It is a circumstance not generally known, but believed by the army
  which served under General Wolfe, that his death-wound was not received
  by the common chance of war, but given by a deserter from his own
  regiment. The circumstances are thus related:&mdash;The General perceived
  one of the sergeants of his regiment strike a man under arms (an act
  against which he had given particular orders), and knowing the man to be
  a good soldier, reprehended the aggressor with much warmth, and
  threatened to reduce him to the ranks. This so far incensed the sergeant,
  that he took the first opportunity of deserting to the enemy, where he
  meditated the means of destroying the General, which he effected by being
  placed in the enemy's left wing, which was directly opposite the right of
  the British line, where Wolfe commanded in person, and where he was
  marked out by the miscreant, who was provided with a rifle piece, and,
  unfortunately for this country, effected his purpose. After the defeat of
  the French army, the deserters were all removed to Crown Point, which
  being afterwards suddenly invested and taken by the British army, the
  whole of the garrison fell into the hands of the captors; when the
  sergeant of whom we have been speaking was hanged for desertion, but
  before the execution of his sentence confessed the facts above
  recited."<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Smith's <i>Marylebone</i>, p. 272., is a notice of Lieutenant
  M&lsquo;Culloch, according to whose plan Wolfe attacked Quebec.
  M&lsquo;Culloch became destitute, and died in Marylebone workhouse in
  1793. A letter from Wolfe to Admiral Saunders is in the <i>Gentleman's
  Magazine</i> for 1801; and one addressed by him to Barré was sold by
  Puttick and Simpson about three years since.</p>

  <p>A portrait of Wolfe by Sir Joshua Reynolds is in possession of Mr.
  Cole of Worcester.</p>

  <p>Since my last notice, I have heard that Mr. Henry George, proprietor
  of the <i>Westerham Journal</i>, made some collections towards a life of
  Wolfe: if so, it is not improbable that Mr. Streatfield obtained them at
  his sale in 1844. In conclusion, I beg to inquire, whence come the lines
  quoted by the Marquis of Lansdowne?&mdash;</p>

<h3>INSCRIPTIONS IN BOOKS.</h3>

  <p>It occurs to me that an interesting collection might be formed of the
  various forms and methods by which the ownership of books is sometimes
  found to be asserted on their fly-leaves. <i>Borrowers</i> are exhorted
  to faithful restitution; and consequences are threatened to those who
  misuse, or fail to return, or absolutely steal the valued literary
  treasure.</p>

  <p>I forward a few such Notes as have fallen in my way, thinking they may
  interest your readers, and shall be obliged by any additions. The first
  is an admonition to borrowers, by no means a superfluous one, as I know
  to my cost. It is <i>printed</i> on a small paper, about the size of an
  ordinary book-plate, with blank for the owner's name, to be filled up in
  manuscript:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p>On the fly-leaf of a Bible I find the following, which, however, is

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A very common formula, in works of a devotional nature, is as
  follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This is Giles Wilkinson his book.</p>

  <p>These last partake somewhat of the character of the diræ and anathemas

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Baptismal Custom.</i>&mdash;In many country parishes the child is
  invariably called by the name of the saint on whose day he happens to
  have been born.</p>

  <p>I know one called <i>Valentine</i>, because he appeared in the world
  upon the 14th of February; and lately baptized a child myself by the name
  of Benjamin <i>Simon Jude</i>. Subsequently, on expressing some surprise
  at the strange conjunction, I was informed that he was born on the
  festival of SS. Simon and Jude, and that it was always <i>very unlucky to
  take the day from a child</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Subterranean Bells.</i>&mdash;Hone, in his <i>Year-Book</i>, gives
  a letter from a correspondent in relation to a tradition in Raleigh,

  <p>But at Raleigh, they say, the old church-bells still ring at Christmas

  listen to the mysterious chimes of the subterranean temple. Is this a

  turning as an amusement, was accustomed to supply his neighbours with
  them, and whose brother always supplied him with the wood, cut from his
  own plantations. It is necessary, in order to be effective, that the ivy
  from which the cups are made should be cut at some particular change of
  the moon, or hour of the night, &amp;c., which I am now unable to
  ascertain: but perhaps some of your readers could give you the exact
  period.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>The Aught and Forty Daugh.</i>&mdash;The lordship of Strathbogie,
  now the property of his Grace the Duke of Richmond, was anciently known
  by this name. It is one of the toasts always drunk at the meetings of
  agricultural associations, the anniversary of his Grace's birthday,
  &amp;c., in the district. The meaning has often puzzled newspaper readers
  at a distance. It was the original estate of the powerful family of
  Gordon in the north of Scotland. A <i>daugh</i>, or <i>davach</i>,
  contains 32 oxgates of 13 acres each, or 416 acres of arable land. At
  <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span>this rate, the whole lordship was
  anciently estimated at 20,000 acres of arable land, and comprehends 120
  square miles in whole.</p>

  <p><i>Alliterative Pasquinade.</i>&mdash;The following alliterative

  <p>"The Earl of Shaftesbury has given notice that he will call the

  The exact terms of his lordship's motion have not as yet been announced;
  but it is understood that it will be in the form of an abstract
  resolution, somewhat to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'That this House, considering the consanguinity and concordant
  consociation of Gog and Magog to be concludent to, and confirmatory of, a
  consimilar connatural conjunction and concatenation between Convocation
  and Confession with its concomitant contaminations, and conceiving the
  congregating, confabulating, and consulting of Convocation to be
  conducive to controversy and contention, and consequent conflicts,
  confusion and convulsion, concurs in the conviction that to convene, and
  to continue Convocation, is a contumacious contravention of the
  Constitution, and a contrivance for constraint of conscience, and that
  the contemptible conspiracy, concocted for concerting the constituting
  and conserving of the continuous concorporal consession and conciliar
  conference of Convocation, is to be contumeliously conculcated by the
  consentient and condign condemnation of this House.'"</p>

  <p><i>The Names "Bonaparte" and "Napoleon."</i>&mdash;Among the many
  fabulous tales that have been published respecting the origin of the name
  of <i>Bonaparte</i>, there in one which, from its ingeniousness and
  romantic character, seems deserving of notice.</p>

  <p>It is said that the "Man in the Iron Mask" was no other than the twin
  (and elder) brother of Louis XIV.; that his keeper's name was
  <i>Bonpart</i>; that that keeper had a daughter, with whom the Man in the
  Mask fell in love, and to whom he was privately married; that their
  children received their mother's name, and were secretly conveyed to
  Corsica, where the name was converted into <i>Bonaparte</i> or
  <i>Buonaparte</i>; and that one of those children was the ancestor of
  Napoleon Bonaparte, who was thus entitled to be recognised not only as of
  French origin, but as the direct descendant of the rightful heir to the
  throne of France.</p>

  <p>The Bonapartes are said to have adopted the name of <i>Napoleon</i>
  from Napoleon des Ursins, a distinguished character in Italian story,
  with one of whose descendants they became connected by marriage; and the
  first of the family to whom it was given was a brother of Joseph
  Bonaparte, the grandfather of Napoleon I. Many are the <i>jeux de
  mots</i> that have been made on this name; but the following, which I
  have just met with in <i>Littérature Française Contemporaine</i>, vol.
  ii. p. 266., is perhaps the most remarkable.</p>

  <p>The word <i>Napoleon</i>, being written in Greek characters, will form
  seven different words, by dropping the first letter of each in
  succession, namely, <span title="Napoleôn, Apoleôn, Poleôn, Oleôn, Leôn, Eôn, Ôn" class="grk"
  >&Nu;&alpha;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&epsilon;&omega;&nu;,
  &Alpha;&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&epsilon;&omega;&nu;,
  &Pi;&omicron;&lambda;&epsilon;&omega;&nu;,
  &Omicron;&lambda;&epsilon;&omega;&nu;, &Lambda;&epsilon;&omega;&nu;,
  &Epsilon;&omega;&nu;, &Omega;&nu;</span>. These words make a complete
  sentence, and are thus translated into French: "Napoléon, étant le lion
  des peuples, allait détruisant les cités."</p>

  <p><i>A Parish Kettle.</i>&mdash;In the accounts of the churchwardens of
  Chudleigh in Devonshire, during a period extending from 1565 to 1651,
  occasional mention is made of "the church chyttel," "parish chettle,"
  "parish chetell or furnace," "parish crock;" and charges are made for
  malt and hops for brewing ale; and the money received for ale sold is
  accounted for. There may also have been provided, for the use of the
  parish, a vessel of smaller dimensions than the crock, for in the year
  1581 there is an entry of 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> received "for the lone of
  the parish panne." As cyder must have been at that time, as it is now,
  the common drink of the working-classes, the parish "crock" must have
  been provided for the use of the occupiers of the land. I suppose that
  the term <i>crock</i>, for a pot made of brass or copper, had its origin
  in times when our cooking-vessels were made of crockeryware.</p>

  <p>I have never seen, in the ancient accounts of churchwardens, any
  mention made of a "town plough," which <span class="sc">Gastros</span>

  "This was the battle of St. Gothard, fought 1st August, so that the news
  reached England in eight days." This would scarcely be possible even in
  these days of railways. The difference of styles must have been

  containing the initials "G. M.," a nameless instrument, or a couple of
  instruments, placed crosswise, and a heart with a cross in the centre.
  Round the edge is cut exquisitely, in Old English letters, with
  contractions such as we see in old MSS., the following inscription, "Hic

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>EXCESSIVE RAINFALL.</h3>

  <p>The following quotation induces me to put a Query to the numerous
  scientific readers of your widely-circulated publication:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is a remarkable circumstance that an unprecedented quantity of
  rain has fallen during the last year (1852) all over the
  world,&mdash;England, Ireland, Europe generally, Africa, India, and even
  in Australia."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Query, Is it anywhere recorded that so widespread a rainfall has been
  previously noticed? It is said that excessive rainfall has been general
  all over the world; and it would appear to have been general over a great
  portion of the land. This, however, does not constitute the whole world.
  The area of our globe is composed of about four-fifths water to one-fifth
  land; so that an excess of rain might fall upon every square mile of
  land, and yet the <i>average</i> rainfall of the whole world not be
  exceeded. This is an important truth, and should be generally understood.
  Taking the surface of the whole world, there is probably, year by year,
  the same amount of sunshine and heat, the same quantity of evaporation,
  and the same volume of rainfall; but there is inequality of distribution.
  We find a dry summer in America, and a wet one in Europe; excessive wet
  in the south of Europe, with excessive drought in the north; with similar
  excesses over much more limited areas. This case holds good even for the
  extraordinary year of 1852. Excess of rain has fallen on most of the land
  over the earth's surface; but there has been a minimum on the great
  oceans; as see the accounts of the fine weather, light winds, and calms,
  experienced in the voyages to Australia.</p>

  <p>The question of general equality and local excesses may now, through
  our commerce, have that attention given to it which has hitherto been
  impossible. It is well worthy of study.</p>

<h3>BAPTIST VINCENT LAVALL.</h3>

  <p>I have in my possession a manuscript of about six hundred pages,
  entitled "Lavall's Tour across the American Continent, from the North
  Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, in a more southern Latitude than any yet
  attempted: performed in the Years 1809 and 1810." A map of the route
  accompanies it.</p>

  <p>The accounts of the country, and of the Indian tribes, correspond with
  what we learn from other sources; and gentlemen of information in Indian
  affairs believe the work to be the genuine production of a person who has
  been over the ground described.</p>

  <p>According to this work, Lavall was a native of Philadelphia, and born
  in 1774. His father, who was a royalist, settled in Upper Canada, and
  engaged in the fur trade. In 1809 Baptist Vincent Lavall visited England
  to receive a legacy left him by a relation. Here he was persuaded to join
  a vessel fitting out for the purpose of trading in the North Pacific. It
  was a schooner of about two hundred tons, called the Sea Otter, commanded
  by Captain Niles. This vessel was lost upon the coast of Oregon, on the
  15th of August, 1809, whilst Lavall and three of the crew were on shore
  hunting. They made their way across the continent to New Orleans.</p>

  <p>Can any information be furnished from any custom-house in England as
  to the Sea Otter, Captain Niles?</p>

  <p>The title engraved on the plate states that the first Richard Graves
  given above, was twice <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>{131}</span>married, and had <i>six</i> sons and
  <i>thirteen</i> daughters. It does not give the Christian names of any of
  the children, and leaves it uncertain whether the Richard Graves who died
  in 1731 was a child of the first or second marriage. This last-mentioned
  Richard was an antiquary of some note, and a correspondent of Hearne, who
  calls him "Gravesius noster."</p>

  <p>Query 1. Is the full pedigree of this family anywhere to be had? 2. Is
  there a record of any of the six sons of the Richard who died in 1669
  having settled in Ireland, as a soldier or otherwise, in the time of the
  Commonwealth? According to Mr. Editor's excellent arrangement, I transmit
  to him a stamped envelope, and shall feel much obliged to any
  correspondent of "N. &amp; Q." who will give me the desired information.
  In the life of the Rev. Richard Graves, a younger son of Richard the
  antiquary (<i>Public Characters</i>, Dublin, 1800 p. 291.), it is stated
  that his collections for the History of the Vale of Gresham came, after
  his death, into the hands of James West, Esq., President of the Royal
  Society, at whose death they were purchased by the Earl of Shelburne,

<h3>SEARSON'S POEMS.</h3>

  <p>The Query of G. C. (Vol. vi., p. 578.) relative to Mrs. Mackey's
  <i>Poems</i>, has induced me to trouble you with a similar one respecting
  the author of a volume in my possession. It is entitled <i>Mount
  Vernon</i>, a Poem, &amp;c. &amp;c., by John Searson, formerly of
  Philadelphia, Merchant; Philadelphia, printed for the author by Folwell.
  After the title-page (which is too long to be given <i>in extenso</i>)
  follows a dedication to General Washington, in which the author, after
  recording that he last returned to America from Ireland in 1796, and that
  having been established for several years at Philadelphia as a merchant,
  he had been subjected to unforeseen losses in trade and merchandize,
  proceeds as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Having a pretty good education in my youth, from an uncle, a
  clergyman of the Church of England, I published two poems in Ireland, was
  well received, and two publications since my last arrival in America,
  having disposed of the last copy of one thousand, <i>Art of
  Contentment</i>, and did myself the honour to visit your Excellency 15th
  May last [1799], so as to obtain an adequate idea of Mount Vernon,
  wishing to compose a poem on that beautiful seat, which I now most humbly
  dedicate to your Excellency, with your likeness," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Next follows a "Preface to the readers of Mount Vernon, a Poem," in
  which he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I published a rural, romantic, and descriptive poem of Down Hill, the
  seat of the Earl of Bristol, Bishop of Londonderry, in Ireland; for which
  the gentlemen of that country actually gave me a guinea per copy, and Sir
  George Hill, from Dublin, gave me five guineas in the city of
  Londonderry; more, I am assured, as feeling from my having seen better
  days, than from the intrinsic value of it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Besides <i>Mount Vernon</i>, the book contains several other poems,
  &amp;c., and extends to eighty-three pages, 8vo., with four pages
  subsequently inserted at the end. It is, I believe, a very scarce book in
  America, and the copy I possess is probably unique in this country. Like
  Mrs. Mackey's poems, it seems to have been written in earnest, and it is
  impossible within the limits of an article of this nature to give an
  adequate idea of the vein of self-complacency which pervades the book, or
  of the high estimation in which the author evidently held his own
  productions both in prose and verse.</p>

  <p>A few quotations illustrative of his descriptive powers must
  suffice:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Mount Vernon! I have often heard of thee,</p>
      <p>And often wish'd thy beauties for to see."&mdash;P. 9.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The house itself is elegant and neat,</p>
      <p>And is two stories high, neat and complete."&mdash;P. 10.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A thought now strikes my mind, of Mount Vernon,</p>
      <p>That happiness may ever shine thereon;</p>
      <p>For, Nature form'd it pleasing to the mind;</p>
      <p>Therefore, true earthly bliss we here might find:</p>
      <p>Or, in a cottage, if our God be there,</p>
      <p>For He is omnipresent, everywhere.</p>
      <p>A garden was the first habitation</p>
      <p>Of our parents, and near relat'on," (<i>sic</i>) &amp;c.&mdash;P. 14.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of Alexandria he informs us that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The buildings here are generally neat,</p>
      <p>The streets well pav'd, which makes walking complete.</p>
      <p>I've seen their houses, where they preach and pray,</p>
      <p>But th' congregation small on stormy day."&mdash;P. 38.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of George Town he says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A pleasing rural prospect rises here,</p>
      <p>To please th' enquiring mind as we draw near.</p>
      <p>The building in George Town is very neat;</p>
      <p>But paving of the streets not yet complete.</p>
      <p>Some rural seats near to the Town is fine,</p>
      <p>Which please the fancy and amuse the mind."&mdash;P. 39.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And lastly, from his <i>Valedictory</i>, we learn that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p>These extracts are not given as the <i>worst</i> specimens. Is
  anything more known of John Searson, and of his other valuable
  productions, either in Ireland or America? As I perceive you have

  information on the subject.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Haberdon, or Habyrdon.</i>&mdash;A manor now belonging to the
  school at Bury St. Edmund's bears this name. Can any meaning be given to
  the word?</p>

  <p>The land formerly belonging to the Abbey of St. Edmund, several
  registers of that monastery, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1520 and 1533,
  let the said manor of Habyrdon, on condition the tenant should yearly
  find one white bull, &amp;c. The leases all describe this manor of
  Habyrdon and make it specially necessary to find a white bull. The land
  is contiguous to the town of Bury, and is called Haberdon at the present
  time, presents a hilly appearance and remains of ancient intrenchments. I
  have not heard of any other place by this name.</p>

  <p><i>Holles Family.</i>&mdash;I am very desirous of obtaining any
  information that can be procured concerning the Holles family prior to
  the time of Sir William, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1540. I should
  also be obliged if any of your numerous correspondents can inform me,
  whether that member of the family who married a lady named Gelks, I think
  since 1700, left any posterity; from whom he was descended, and in what
  county he lived? Also, who the Gelkses were, and whether the family is
  represented now; and, if so, of what county they are?</p>

  <p>The arms of the Holleses were&mdash;Ermine, two piles conjoining in
  the points sable. The crest was a boar's head erased, azure, langued
  gules, pierced with a pheon.</p>

  <p>The Gelks bore&mdash;Ermine, three chevrons azure, charged with nine
  bezents inter nine annulets gules.</p>

  or whether such names were bestowed upon the heavenly bodies at some
  later date in honour of those divinities?</p>

  <p>I should also like to hear explained, how the word <i>spade</i>, which
  from its affinities in other languages would appear to have originally
  meant <i>sword</i>, ever came to be transferred from a weapon of war to
  the useful and harmless implement it now designates.</p>

  <p><i>Consecrators of English Bishops.</i>&mdash;It may appear a waste of
  space to insert in your columns my Queries on this subject, but when you
  consider that I have been an exile in India for the last eleven years,
  and consequently unable to refer, in this country, to authorities, which
  are easily accessible at home, I venture to hope that you will not only
  give a place to this, but also that you, or some clerical reader of "N.
  &amp; Q.," will afford me the required information.</p>

  <p>I have continued Mr. Perceval's list of English consecrations, given
  in his able work, <i>An Apology for the Doctrine of Apostolical
  Succession</i>, 2nd edition of 1841, but have been unable to complete it
  with the names of the consecrators of the following prelates, the objects
  of my Query; viz. 1. Bishop Gilbert, of Chichester, on 27th February,
  1842; 2. Bishop Field, of Newfoundland, 28th April, 1844; 3, 4, &amp; 5.
  Bishops Turton of Ely, Medley of Fredericton, and Chapman of <!-- Page
  133 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span>Colombo,
  on 4th May, 1845; 6. Bishop Gobat, 5th July, 1846; 7 &amp; 8. Bishops
  Smith of Victoria, and Anderson of Rupert's Land, on 29th May, 1849; 9.
  Bishop Fulford of Montreal, 25th July, 1850; and 10. Bishop Harding of
  Bombay, on 12th August, 1851. The dates are, I believe, correct, but if
  not, of course I should like the mistakes to be pointed out. I also
  desiderate the date of Bishop Binney's (of Nova Scotia) consecration, in
  March or April, 1851, with names of his consecrators; and finally, the
  place of Bishop Lonsdale's (of Lichfield) consecration, on 3rd December,
  1843. If these data are supplied, the lacunæ in my supplemental list of
  English consecrations, from the Reformation to the present day, will be
  complete.</p>

  <p><i>Gospel Place.</i>&mdash;In a definition of the boundaries of
  Bordesley Abbey, dated 1645, given in Nash's <i>Worcestershire</i>, there
  frequently occurs the term "Gospel place," thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And so to a Cross or Gospel Place near to Brown's cottage, and from
  thence to a Gospel Place under a tree near to a mill ... thence to the
  old Gospel Place oak that standeth on the common."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have heard that at each one of these "Gospel places" there was kept
  up a mound on which it was usual to rest a corpse on its way to the
  churchyard, during which time some portion of the gospel was read. Can
  any of your correspondents say if such a practice was observed in any
  other part of the country, its origin, its intention, and the period of
  its discontinuance? And if not, can give any other explanation of the

  <p><i>Chipchase of Chipchase.</i>&mdash;I should be glad to learn if any
  pedigree exists of the ancient family of Chipchase, or De Chipches (as
  the name is spelt in pleadings and deeds of the fourteenth century). A
  family bearing that name appears to have occupied or dwelt near the
  "Turris de Chipches," co. Northumberland, so early as Edward I.; at which
  time the manor of Prudhoe, of which Chipchase is a member, was held by
  the Umfravilles. The fact of the principal charges in the armorial
  bearings of both families being similar, seems to have led to the
  suggestion that the Chipchases were cadets of the former; but this
  opinion is without sufficient foundation.</p>

  "Vol. 158. No. 8231." This gives the year 1695 as the commencement of the
  paper. Perhaps other readers of "N. &amp; Q." will follow up this
  interesting subject. Vide Vol. ii., p. 375., and Vol. iii., pp. 164. and

  <p><i>On alleged historical Facts.</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"During the troubles in the reign of Charles I., a country girl came
  up to London in search of a place as a servant-maid; but not succeeding,
  she applied herself to carrying out beer from a brewhouse, and was one of
  those then called 'tub-women.' The brewer observing a well-looking girl
  in this low occupation, took her into his family as servant, and, after a
  little while, she behaving herself with so much prudence and decorum, he
  married her; but he died when she was yet a young woman, and left her a
  large fortune. The business of the brewery was dropped, and the young
  woman was recommended to Mr. Hyde, as a gentleman of skill in the law, to
  settle her affairs. Hyde (who was afterwards the great Earl of
  Clarendon), finding the widow's fortune very considerable, married her.
  Of this marriage there was no other issue than a daughter, who was
  afterwards the wife of James II., and mother of Mary and Anne, queens of
  England."&mdash;<i>Newspaper Paragraph.</i></p>

  <p><i>Quotation.</i>&mdash;In the Miscellaneous Writings of the

  <p>"It is recorded of Methusalem, who, being the longest liver, may be
  supposed to have best preserved his health, that he slept always in the
  open air; for when he had lived five hundred years, an angel said to him,
  'Arise, Methusalem, and build thee an house; for thou shalt live yet five
  hundred years longer.' But Methusalem answered and said, 'If I am to live
  but five hundred years longer, it is not worth while to build me an
  house: I will sleep in the open air as I have been used to do.'"</p>

  <p>But this is probably a mistake, as, in a short account of his life by

  <p>"After Queen Elizabeth had been settled in the throne for some time,

  <p>It appears, from Dugdale's <i>Warwickshire</i>, that Pursglove
  assented to the suppression of Gisburne in December, 1540, and became a
  commissioner for persuading other abbots and priors to do the same. It is
  doubtful at what time he was appointed to the see of Hull; whether in the
  last year of Edward VI. or in Queen Mary's reign, though it is certain,
  in 1559, he refused to take the oath of supremacy to Elizabeth.</p>

<h3>THE GREGORIAN TONES.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 99. 178.)</p>

  <p>I have neither time nor inclination to expose all the errors and
  fallacies of <span class="sc">Mr. Matthew Cooke's</span> article on
  "Gregorian Tones;" but I cannot resist pointing out certain statements
  which are calculated to mislead the readers of "N. &amp; Q." in no
  trifling degree. The writer says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The most ancient account we have is, that St. Ambrose of Milan knew
  of <i>four</i> tones in his day, and that he added <i>four</i> others to
  them; the former being those termed authentic, the latter the plagal
  modes."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now the fact is, that St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan (<span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 374 to 397), chose from the ancient Greek modes
  four series or successions of notes, and called them simply the first,
  second, third, and fourth tones; laying completely aside the ancient
  heathen names of Doric, Phrygian, Lydian, Ionic, &amp;c. St. Gregory the
  Great, who governed the Christian Church from <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 591 to 604, added the <i>four additional</i>
  tones. These eight ecclesiastical successions or scales, which still
  exist as such in the music of the Roman Liturgy, are called Gregorian
  after their founder. Thus the old Ambrosian chant is known at present
  only through the medium of the Gregorian.</p>

  <p>The writer continues his statement in these words&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Some years since, the renowned French theorist, Mons. Fetis, went to
  Milan for the express purpose of consulting the celebrated <i>Book of
  Offices</i>, written by St. Ambrose <i>in his own handwriting, which is
  there preserved</i> [the Italics are added]; and in his work, published
  in Belgium, he says that he collated them with those known and received
  amongst us; and that the variations were of the slightest possible
  character, the tones being ostensibly the same."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This extraordinary statement cannot be accepted without the title of
  M. Fetis' work, and the passage upon which it rests, <i>verbatim</i> in
  the author's own words. But I have no hesitation in saying that it is
  founded in error.</p>

  <p>Thibaut (<i>Ueber der Reinheit der Tonkunst</i>, pp. 28-30.) speaks of
  a MS. of the Gregorian chants at St. Gall, in Switzerland, as old as the
  <i>ninth</i> century. This is believed, by all accredited modern writers
  upon music, to be the oldest MS. of the tones extant.</p>

<h3>LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST, ACT V. SC. 2.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 268. 296.)</p>

  <p>Of this passage we might almost say <i>conclamatum est</i>; for really
  no good sense has yet been made of it, except by bold alterations. For my
  own part, I agree with A. E. B., that <i>no alteration is required</i>
  except in the punctuation, and not much even then. The text of the folios
  is given by <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> (Vol. vi., p. 268.), and I
  would read it thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now.</p>
      <p>That sport best pleases that doth least know how,</p>
      <p>Where zeal strives to content, and the contents</p>
      <p>Dies <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'with', corrected by erratum in Issue 172.">in</span> the zeal of that which it presents.</p>
      <p>Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,</p>
      <p>When great things labouring perish in the birth."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The whole difficulty seems to lie in the word <i>dies</i> in the
  fourth line, and that I think may be removed by merely changing <i>i</i>
  into <i>y</i>, and reading <i>dyes</i>. The meaning then will be: That
  sport will yield most pleasure in which, though the actors are devoid of
  skill, they are zealous and anxious to give pleasure for their zeal in
  the endeavour, <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page137"></a>{137}</span><i>dyes</i>, or tinges (<i>i. e.</i>
  communicates its own hue to) the <i>contents</i> or satisfaction of the
  spectators (<i>i. e.</i> makes them sympathise with the actors). While on
  the other hand: My good lord, when, as in your late attempt, great things
  labouring perish in the birth, <i>their</i> confusion causes laughter and
  derision instead of pleasure, like the former simple effort.</p>

  <p>I take, as will be seen, <i>contents</i>, in the third line, as the
  substantive of the preceding verb <i>content</i>, and not, with <span
  class="sc">Mr. Knight</span> and A. E. B., as "things contained." The
  poet put it in the plural evidently for the sake of the rhyme. In the
  next line, <i>zeal</i> may not be the word actually written by the poet,
  but it makes a very fair sense; and I know no word that could be
  substituted for it with certainty&mdash;we still use the phrase, <i>to
  dye in</i>. In understanding the last two lines of the <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'remark', corrected by erratum in Issue 172."
  >mask</span> of the king and his lords, I think I am justified by the
  remark of Byron:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A right description of our sport, my Lord."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Perhaps it is needless to add, that <i>labouring</i> is i.q.
  <i>travailing</i>; and that <i>most form in mirth</i> means <i>the
  highest form in</i> (i. e. <i>the greatest degree of</i>)
  <i>mirth</i>.</p>

  <p>In these, and any other remarks on Shakspeare with which I may happen
  to trouble you at any time, I beg to be regarded as a mere
  <i>guerilla</i> as compared with regularly trained and disciplined
  Shakspearians like <i>Mr. Singer</i>, <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span>, and others. I have never read the folios of 1623 or 1632.
  I do not even possess a <i>variorum</i> edition of the poet; my only copy
  being Mr. Collier's excellent edition. Finally, my studies have lain most
  about the sunny shores of the Mediterranean; and I am most at home in the
  literature of its three peninsulas, and the coasts of Asia.</p>

<h3>NIÁGARA, OR NIAGÁRA.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 552.; Vol. vii., p. 50.)</p>

  <p>As I consider J. G.'s apology for the popular, though undoubtedly
  erroneous, pronunciation of this word to be far from satisfactory, may I
  trouble you with some evidence in favour of Niagára, which <span
  class="sc">Mr. W. Fraser</span> truly says is the Huron pronunciation? I
  also agree with him, that it is "unquestionably the most musical." For my
  own part, the sound of Niágara is painful to my ear; even Moore himself
  could not knock music out of it. Witness the following lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Take, instead of a bowl, or a dagger, a</p>
      <p>Desperate dash down the Falls of Niágara."<a name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>How very different is the measured, solemn sound, which the word bears
  in the noble lines of Goldsmith, who, it is reasonable to suppose, was as
  well informed of its proper pronunciation as of its correct
  interpretation.</p>

  <p>Travelling a few years since in Canada, I was assured by an old
  gentleman, who for many years held constant intercourse with the
  aborigines, that they invariably place the accent upon the penult. If
  this be true, as I doubt not, it is conclusive: and in order to testify
  to the correctness of the assertion, I could cite numberless aboriginal
  names of places in "The States," as well as in Canada: a few, however,
  will here suffice:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Stadacóna.</p>
      <p>Hochelága.</p>
      <p>Torónto.</p>
      <p>Mississíppi.</p>
      <p>Alleghány.</p>
      <p>Apalachicóla.</p>
      <p>Saratóga.</p>
      <p>Ticonderóga.</p>
      <p>Narragánset.</p>
      <p>Oswégo.</p>
      <p>Canandáigua.</p>
      <p>Tuscalóosa.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now, I am aware that there are other Indian words which would seem, at
  first sight, if not to contradict, to be at least exceptions to the rule,
  but upon investigation they, I conceive, rather strengthen my argument:
  for instance, Connécticut&mdash;the original of which is, Quonehtácut,
  the long river.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, we should bear in mind that we have the prevalent
  pronunciation of such words through either of two channels,&mdash;the
  French or the American; consequently, in Canada, we find them
  Frenchified, and in "The States" Yankeefied.</p>

  <p>I therefore hold that Niágara is a most inharmonious Yankeefication of
  the melodious aboriginal word Niagára.</p>

<h3>DRENGAGE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 39.)</p>

  <p>The tenure in <i>drengage</i> was common in, if it was not confined
  to, the territory which was comprised in the ancient kingdom of
  Northumbria. <i>Drenghs</i> are mentioned in Domesday on the lands
  between the Ribble and the Mersey, which then formed part of Northumbria.
  They occur in Yorkshire; and they are mentioned in the survey, called the
  <i>Boldon Book</i>, compiled in <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1183, by
  order of Hugh Pudsey, the great Bishop of Durham, which may be termed the
  Domesday of the palatinate. Sir Henry Ellis, in his <i>General Introd. to
  Domesday</i>, says, "The <i>drenchs</i> or <i>drenghs</i> were of the
  description of allodial tenants ... and from the few entries in which
  they occur, it certainly appears that the allotments of territory they
  possessed were held as manors." (<i>Domesd.</i>, tom. i. fo. 269.) But as
  menial services (to be rendered, nevertheless, by the villans of the
  tenant in <i>drengage</i>) were attached to the tenure, at all events in
  the county of Durham, it was inferior to military tenure; and the
  instance in the Pipe Rolls of Westmoreland, 25 Henry II., of the
  enfranchisement of <i>drenghs</i>, together with the particulars <!--
  Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span>given
  in records of the palatinate of Durham and the county of Northumberland,
  as to the services attached to <i>drengage</i>, show that it was far from
  being a free tenure. Yet Spelman (<i>Gloss.</i>, ed. 1687, p. 184.)
  speaks of <i>drenges</i> as "tenantes per servitium militare;" and Coke
  calls them "free tenants of a manor."<a name="footnotetag6"
  href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> From the <i>Boldon Book</i> we
  learn, however, that the services of the <i>drengh</i> were to plough,
  sow, and harrow a portion of the bishop's land, to keep a dog and horse
  for the bishop's use, and a cart to convey his wine; to attend the chase
  with dogs and ropes; and perform certain "precaria," or harvest works. To
  take an example from the roll of Bishop de Bury in 1336:&mdash;We find
  Nicholas de Oxenhale held of the bishop in capite the manor of Oxenhale,
  performing, amongst other services, "the fourth part of a
  <i>drengage</i>; to wit, he was to plough four acres, and sow the land
  with seed of the bishop's, and harrow it, and do four days' work in
  autumn." And in the Pipe Roll for Westmoreland, already mentioned, we
  find eighteen <i>drenghs</i> in the honour held by Hugh de Morvill, who
  had not been enfranchised by him, and who remained paying a fine to be
  exempt from foreign service. In Northumberland the tenants in
  <i>drengage</i> paid a fixed money-rent, and were subject to tallage,
  heriots, merchet, &amp;c. So, in the palatinate, in 25th Bishop Hatfield
  (<span class="sm">A. D.</span> 1369), John Warde, of Hoton, died seised
  in his demesne of a messuage and sixty acres which were held of the
  bishop in capite, by homage and fealty in <i>drengage</i>, rendering six
  bushels of oats and three bushels of barley, at the manor of Middleham.
  But the agricultural and menial services were lighter than those of the
  villan, and, as already stated, were not performed by the tenant in
  person, or by those of his household. This tenure existed in Tynedale at
  the close of the thirteenth century, as appears from <i>Rot. Orig. 20
  Edw. I.</i>, vol. i. p. 70., where the "consuetudinem partium
  prædictarum" are mentioned. "A <i>drengage</i>," says Blount, in his
  <i>Fragmenta Antiquitatis</i>, "seems to have consisted of sixteen acres,
  to be ploughed, sown, and harrowed." The word <i>drengage</i> is derived,
  by the Rev. Wm. Greenwell, in the glossary to his recent valuable edition
  of <i>Boldon Book</i>, from the Anglo-Saxon <i>dreogan</i>, to do, work,
  bear; the root, according to Tooke, of our English word <i>drudge</i>.
  <i>Drengage</i> is, in Kelham's <i>Norman-French Dictionary</i>,
  explained to be "the tenure by which the <i>drenges</i> held their
  lands." In Lye's <i>Saxon Dictionary</i> I find "<i>Dreng</i>, miles, vir
  fortis."</p>

<h3>CHATTERTON.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 14.)</p>

  <p>The following account of the whole of the proceedings at the inquest
  which was held at the Three Crows, Brook Street, Holborn, on Friday, Aug.
  27, 1770, before Swinson Carter, Esq., and ten jurymen, whose names are
  mentioned, is from a MS. copy in my possession.</p>

  <p>I am not acquainted with any printed work which contains a report of
  the inquest. It is not in the large collection of Chatterton's
  <i>Works</i> and <i>Lives</i>, and the innumerable newspaper and magazine
  cuttings, which fill several volumes, and which belonged to Mr.
  Haslewood; nor is it in Barrett's <i>Bristol</i>, or Herbert Croft's
  <i>Love and Madness</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

</blockquote>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Mary Angell</span>, sack maker, of No. 17. Brook
  Street, Holborn, deposed, that the deceased came to lodge at her house
  about nine or ten weeks ago; he took the room below the garret; he always
  slept in the same room; he was always very exact in his payments to her;
  and at one time, when she knew that he had paid her all the money he had
  in the world, she offered him sixpence back, which he refused to take,
  saying: 'I have that here (pointing to his forehead) which will get me
  more.' He used to sit up nearly all night, and she frequently found his
  bed untouched in the morning, when she went to make it. She knew that he
  always bought his loaves&mdash;one of which lasted him for a
  week&mdash;as stale as possible, that they might last the longer: and,
  two days before his death, he came home in a great passion with the
  baker's wife, who had refused to let him have another loaf until he paid
  her 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> which he owed her previously. He, the deceased,
  appeared unusually grave on the 28th of August; and, on her asking him
  what ailed him, he answered pettishly: 'Nothing, nothing&mdash;why do you
  ask?' On the morning of the 24th August, he lay in bed longer than usual;
  got up about ten o'clock, and went out with a bundle of paper under his
  arm, which he said 'was a treasure to any one, but there were so many
  fools in the world that he would put them in a place of safety, lest they
  should meet with accident.' He returned about seven in the evening,
  looking very pale and dejected; and would not eat anything, but sat
  moping by the fire with his chin on his knees, and muttering rhymes in
  some old language to her. Witness saw him for the last time when <!--
  Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>{139}</span>he
  got up to go to bed; he then kissed her (a thing he had never done in his
  life before), and then went upstairs, stamping on every stair as he went
  slowly up, as if he would break it. Witness stated that he did not come
  down next morning, but she was not alarmed, as he had lain longer than
  usual on the day before; but at eleven o'clock, Mrs. Wolfe, a neighbour's
  wife, coming in, they went and listened at the door, and tried to open
  it, but it was locked. At last, they got a man who was near to break it
  open; and they found him lying on the bed with his legs hanging over,
  quite dead: the bed had not been lain on. The floor was covered all over
  with little bits of paper; and on one piece the man read, in deceased's
  handwriting, 'I leave my soul to its Maker, my body to my mother and
  sister, and my curse to Bristol. If Mr. Ca....' The rest was torn off.
  The man then said he must have killed himself, which we did not think
  till then, not having seen the poison till an hour after. Deceased was
  very proud, but never unkind to any one. I do not think he was quite
  right in his mind lately. The man took away the paper, and I have not
  been able to find him out.</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Frederick Angell</span> deposed to the fact of
  deceased lodging at their house; was from home when deceased was found.
  Always considered him something wonderful, and was sometimes afraid he
  would go out of his mind. Deceased often came home very melancholy; and,
  on his once asking him the reason, he said, 'Hamilton has deceived me;'
  but could get no more from him. Deceased was always writing to his mother
  or sister, of whom he appeared to be very fond. I never knew him in
  liquor, and never saw him drink anything but water.</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Edwin Cross</span>, apothecary, Brook Street,
  Holborn. Knew the deceased well, from the time he came to live with Mrs.
  Angell in the same street. Deceased used generally to call on him every
  time he went by his door, which was usually two or three times in a day.
  Deceased used to talk a great deal about physic, and was very inquisitive
  about the nature of different poisons. I often asked him to take a meal
  with us, but he was so proud that I could never but once prevail on him,
  though I knew he was half-starving. One evening he did stay, when I
  unusually pressed him. He talked a great deal, but all at once became
  silent, and looked quite vacant. He used to go very often to Falcon
  Court, Fleet Street, to a Mr. Hamilton, who printed a magazine; but who,
  he said, was using him very badly. I once recommended him to return to
  Bristol, but he only heaved a deep sigh; and begged me, with tears in his
  eyes, never to mention the hated name again. He called on me on the 24th
  August about half-past eleven in the morning, and bought some arsenic,
  which he said was for an experiment. About the same time next day, Mrs.
  Wolfe ran in for me, saying deceased had killed himself. I went to his
  room, and found him quite dead. On his window was a bottle containing
  arsenic and water; some of the little bits of arsenic were between his
  teeth. I believe if he had not killed himself, he would soon have died of
  starvation; for he was too proud to ask of any one. Witness always
  considered deceased as an astonishing genius.</p>

  <p>"<span class="sc">Anne Wolfe</span>, of Brook Street. Witness lived
  three doors from Mrs. Angell's; knew the deceased well; always thought
  him very proud and haughty. She sometimes thought him crazed. She saw him
  one night walking up and down the street at twelve o'clock, talking loud,
  and occasionally stopping, as if to think on something. One day he came
  in to buy some curls, which he said he wanted to send to his sister; but
  he could not pay the price, and went away seemingly much mortified. On
  the 25th August, Mrs. Angell asked her to go upstairs with her to
  Thomas's room: they could make no one hear. And, at last, being
  frightened, they got a man who was going by to break open the door, when
  they found him dead on the bed. The floor was covered with little bits of
  paper, and the man who was with them picked up several and took away with
  him.</p>

<h3>LITERARY FRAUDS OF MODERN TIMES.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 86.)</p>

  <p>It is not for P. C. S. S. to explain the grounds on which Cardinal
  Wiseman considers the <i>History of Formosa</i>, and the <i>Sicilian Code
  of Vella</i>, as the most celebrated literary frauds of modern times. But
  he thinks that before he penned the Query, <span class="sc">Mr.
  Breen</span> might have recollected the well-known name of <i>George
  Psalmanazar</i>, and the extraordinary imposture so successfully
  practised in 1704 by that good and learned person; a fraud scarcely
  redeemed by the virtue and merits of a man of whom Dr. Johnson said, that
  "he had never seen the close of the life of any one that he so much
  wished his own to resemble, as that of Psalmanazar, for its purity and
  devotion."</p>

  <p>With respect to the <i>Sicilian Code of Vella</i>, <span
  class="sc">Mr. Breen</span> will find, on a very little inquiry, that the
  work to which the Cardinal adverts (entitled <i>Libro del Consiglio di
  Egitto, tradotto da Giuseppe Vella</i>) was printed at Palermo in 1793;
  that the book, from beginning to end, is an entire fiction of the learned
  canon; that the forgery was detected before the publication of the second
  part&mdash;which, consequently, never saw the light; that the detection
  was due to the celebrated orientalist Hager, whose account thereof (a
  masterpiece of <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>{140}</span>analytical reasoning) was published in
  1799 by Palm, the bookseller of Erlang (murdered in 1806 by order of the
  uncle of the present French emperor). But this was not the only imposture
  of the kind of which Vella was the author, and which his profound
  knowledge of Arabic enabled him to execute in a way which it would
  scarcely have been possible for any other European to have accomplished.
  He had published, 1791, at the Royal Press at Palermo, under the name of
  Alfonso Airoldi, a fictitious <i>Codex Diplomaticus Siciliæ, sub
  Saracenorum Imperio</i>, to the discovery of which ingenious fraud we are
  also indebted to the acute Pyrrhonism of M. Hager.</p>

<h3>SIR H. WOTTON'S LETTER TO MILTON.</h3>

  <p>I am obliged to apologise for having made Sir Henry Wotton use the
  words "some long time before," instead of "some good while before," and
  therefore take the opportunity of saying that I think Sir Henry's
  allusion to "the art of stationers," in binding a good and a bad book up
  together, almost proves "our common friend Mr. R." to have been a
  bookseller. Notwithstanding the very high authorities against me, I will
  then venture to insinuate, that instead of John Rouse, or Robert
  Randolph, plain Humphrey <i>Robinson</i> is meant, by whom <i>Comus</i>
  was printed in 1637, "at the signe of the Three Pidgeons, in Paul's
  Church-yard."</p>

  <p>Once grant the probability of this being the case, and we have no
  further difficulty in understanding why <i>Comus</i> should be stitched
  up "with the late Rd. poems," or Wotton be left in ignorance of the
  author's name. Lawes tells us in the dedication to <i>Comus</i>, that it
  was "not openly acknowledged by the author;" and the publisher would
  naturally keep the secret: but why Rouse or Robert Randolph should do so,
  appears to me inexplicable. I hope soon to have access to some public
  libraries, and also to return to this very interesting question again.
  Meanwhile, may I beg the forbearance of your more learned
  correspondents?</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Sir W. Newton's Process.</i>&mdash;Having been requested by several
  friends to give them a statement of my mode of proceeding with reference
  to the calotypic art, and as I am of opinion that we ought to assist each
  other as much as possible in the pursuit of this important branch of
  photography, I beg therefore to offer the following for insertion in your
  "N. &amp; Q.," if you should deem them worth your acceptance.</p>

  <p><i>To iodize the Paper.</i>&mdash;1st. Brush your paper over with
  muriate of barytes (half an ounce, dissolved in nearly a wine-bottle of
  distilled water): lay it flat to dry. 2nd. Dissolve sixty grains of
  nitrate of silver in about an ounce of distilled water. Ditto sixty
  grains of iodide of potassium in another bottle with the like quantity of
  water. Mix them together and shake well: let it subside: pour off the
  water, and then add <i>hot</i> water: shake it well: let subside: pour
  off the water, and then add three ounces of distilled water, and
  afterwards as much iodide of potassium as will redissolve the iodide of
  silver.</p>

  <p>Brush your previously prepared paper well with this, and let dry; then
  place them in water, one by one, for about one hour and a half or two
  hours, <i>constantly agitating the water</i>. As many as a dozen pieces
  may be put into the water, one after the other, taking care that there
  are no air-bubbles: take them out, and pin to the edge of a board at one
  corner.</p>

  <p>When dry they will be ready for exciting for the camera by the
  following process:</p>

<p class="ac">(These are supposed to be in six 1-ounce bottles with
glass stoppers.)</p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

  <p><i>To excite for the Camera.</i>&mdash;Mix equal parts of Nos. 1. and
  2., and with a glass rod excite the iodized paper and blot off; and it
  may be put in the slide at once, or the number you require may be
  excited, and put into a blotting paper book, one between each leaf, and
  allowed to remain until required to be placed in the slide.</p>

  <p><i>Time of Exposure.</i>&mdash;The time varies from three minutes to a
  quarter of an hour, according to the nature of the subject and the power
  of the sun; but five minutes is <i>generally</i> the proper time.</p>

  <p><i>To bring out.</i>&mdash;Bring out with No. 3., and when the subject
  begins to appear, add No. 5.; and when sufficiently developed hold it up,
  and pour water upon it; and then put it into hyposulphite of soda to fix
  it, for about half an hour <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>{141}</span>or more, and then into water: this is
  merely to fix it for the after process at your leisure.</p>

  <p><i>To clean the Negative.</i>&mdash;Get a zinc tray about three or
  four inches deep, with another tray to fit in at the top, about one inch
  deep; fill the lower tray with boiling water, so that the upper tray may
  touch the water; put your solution of hyposulphite of soda, not strong,
  in the upper tray, and then your negatives one by one, watching them with
  care until the iodine is removed; then put them in hot water, containing
  a small piece of common soda (the size of a nutmeg to about two quarts of
  water), for about ten minutes; pour off the dirty water, and then add
  more hot water, shaking them gently for a short time; pour off the water
  again, and then add fresh hot water, and let it remain until it is cold,
  after which take them out <span class="sm">CAREFULLY</span>, one by one,
  and put them in clean cold water for an hour or two; then take them
  <i>all out together</i>, and hold up to drain for a short time, and then
  put them between three or four thicknesses of linen, and press as much of
  the water out as you can; then <i>carefully</i> (<i>for now all the size
  is removed</i>) lay them out flat upon linen to dry.</p>

  <p><i>Mode of Waxing the Negatives.</i>&mdash;Melt the pure white wax
  over a lamp of moderate heat, just merely to keep it in a liquid state;
  then fill the same deep tray as above described with boiling water, and
  with <i>another</i> similar to the upper one before described (<i>which
  must be kept for this purpose only</i>); put a clean piece of
  blotting-paper in this tray, and lay your negative <i>face downwards</i>,
  and with a soft <i>flat</i> hog's hair-brush, about an inch wide, dip it
  into the liquid wax, and brush the negative over, when it will be
  immediately transparent, and it can be done so that there is very little
  redundant wax, after which it may be put between two or three thicknesses
  of blotting-paper and ironed, if necessary, which, however, should not be
  <i>very</i> hot, when it is ready to take positives from.</p>

  <p><i>Positives on Negative Paper.</i>&mdash;Take one part of the iodide
  of silver before described, and add two parts of water; then add as much
  iodide of potassium as will redissolve it. Brush your paper with the
  foregoing, let dry, put into water, and proceed, in all respects, as
  above described for the negatives.</p>

  <p><i>Excite for Positives.</i>&mdash;Excite with No. 1.; blot off: lay
  it in your press, place the negative face downwards: expose to the light
  from ten seconds to half a minute, or more, according to the light
  (<i>not in the sun</i>), and bring out with No. 3.; and when it is nearly
  developed add No. 1.; then take it up and pour water upon it, and then
  place it in hyposulphite of soda (cold) until the iodine is removed;
  after which put it into allum water, about half a teaspoonful of powdered
  allum in two quarts of water; this will readily remove the hyposulphite,
  and also fix the positive more particularly; it will also take away any
  impurities which there may be in the paper, after which put it into clean
  cold water, and change two or three times.</p>

  <p>I have been thus particular in describing the process which I have
  adopted, more especially for beginners; and with great cleanliness and
  care in each process, and especially in keeping all the bottles with the
  chemicals free from dirt of every kind, the foregoing will lead to
  favourable results.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">W. J. Newton.</span></p>

  <p>I have been making some experiments in preparing the iodized paper in
  the following manner, more especially in consideration of the present
  price of iodide of potassium:&mdash;60 grains of nitrate of silver; 60
  ditto of iodide of potassium, cleaned and prepared as before described,
  by the addition of three ounces of water,&mdash;that is 3 oz. altogether;
  60 grains of cyanide of potassium; add a little of this at a time, and
  shake it up; and I generally find that this quantity is sufficient to
  redissolve the 60 grains of iodide of silver. Brush the paper over with
  the above, and when the wet surface disappears, dip it into cold water
  containing one drachm of dilute sulphuric acid to one quart of water; and
  then into water for half an hour, changing the water once: pin up to dry.
  I have not had an opportunity of trying this for negatives, but I have
  taken some good positives with the paper so prepared.</p>

  <p>N.B.&mdash;I find that if the paper is allowed to dry with the cyanide
  of potassium, or that it is allowed to remain in the dilute sulphuric
  acid water too long, it weakens the paper so much as to be very
  absorbent. I would therefore wish to know from any of your correspondents
  whether this arises from taking away the size, or injuring the fibres of
  the paper? and, if so, whether a paper prepared with starch, instead of
  size, would be better? as it appears to me that this mode of iodizing
  might be an improvement. At all events, it is an enormous saving of
  iodide of potassium; as, for instance, to redissolve the 60 grains, it
  would take 1½ oz. of iodide of potassium (about four shillings); whereas
  60 grains of cyanide would not cost more than one penny or twopence.</p>

  <p class="author">W. J. N.</p>

  <p><i>Collodion Film on Copper Plates.</i>&mdash;Would any of your
  correspondents kindly describe the manner in which the collodion film may
  be transferred to prepared copper plates?</p>

  <p>It was noticed by your correspondent H. W. D. in Vol. vi., p. 470.</p>

  <p class="author">J. M. S.</p>

  <p><i>Treatment of the Paper Positive after fixing.</i>&mdash;1. Is it
  absolutely necessary for the preservation of the picture, that the size
  should be wholly removed from the paper? It seems to me that the
  hot-water treatment materially injures the tone. <!-- Page 142 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>{142}</span></p>

  <p>2. In re-sizing, what is the kind of size and degree of strength
  generally made use of, and mode of application? I have tried gelatine and
  isinglass size, of various degrees of strength, without satisfactory
  results.</p>

  <p>3. Should the hot iron, used for improvement of tone, be applied
  previous to the picture being re-sized, or as a finishing operation? I
  find much difficulty from the liability of the paper to shrivel under
  it.</p>

  <p>4. Is the glossy appearance, observed in finished photographs,
  attained solely by use of the burnisher?</p>

  <p>5. What is albumenized paper? used, I believe, by some in printing;
  and the mode of its preparation?</p>

  <p class="author">H. B. B.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;If I am not presuming too much upon your kindness, I should
  feel greatly indebted for information upon the above points, either
  privately or through the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," according to the
  importance you may attach to them.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Essay for a New Translation of the Bible</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  40.).&mdash;This work was written by Charles Le Cene, a French Protestant
  minister, who, on the revocation of the edict of Nantes, sought refuge in
  England, and died at London in 1703. The translation was made by Hugh
  Ross, a Scotchman and sea-chaplain, but who was not sufficiently
  ingenuous to tell his readers that it was a translation. Orme says: "The
  essay contains a good deal of valuable information; points out many
  erroneous renderings of passages of Scripture; and suggests better
  meanings, and the means of correcting the modern translations
  generally."&mdash;<i>Bibliothecha Biblica</i>, p. 94. A short account of
  Le Cene will be found in Chalmers's <i>Biog. Dict.</i> See also Lewis's
  <i>Translations of the Bible</i>, 8vo. 1818, p. 338.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John I. Dredge.</span></p>

  <p>I have a copy of the <i>Essay for a New Translation of the Bible</i>,
  second edition, 1727 (not 1717), which your correspondent W. W. T.
  inquires about (Vol. vii., p. 40.). It is the translation of a work of
  the Huguenot refugee, Charles Le Cene, <i>Projet d'une nouvelle version
  françoise de la Bible</i>. H. R., who signs the dedication, was Hugh
  Ross, according to a note in my copy, which my father made on the
  authority of one of the clergy of Norwich about twenty years ago, I
  believe of Dr. Charles Sutton. I have been unable to ascertain anything
  about him, his name not appearing in any biographical dictionary I have
  seen, and the book not being in the Museum library. The <i>Biog.
  Universelle</i> charges Le Cene with a tendency to Pelagian or Socinian
  errors, both in his <i>Projet</i>, and in the <i>Version</i> he actually
  made, and which was printed at Amsterdam. This was a great curiosity in
  its way, the ancient Oriental titles, &amp;c. being rendered in their
  corresponding modern analogues.</p>

  <p><i>Touchstone</i> (Vol. vii., p. 82.).&mdash;I think your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Alphage</span> is mistaken in alleging
  that the word <i>touchstone</i> is so called because it "gives a musical
  sound when touched with a stick."</p>

  <p>The <i>touchstone</i> is the dark-coloured flinty slate or schistus
  (the <i>Lapis Lydius</i> of the ancients), which has been used from the
  remotest ages, down even to our own days, for testing gold. By touching
  the black stone with the metal, it leaves behind a clear mark, the colour
  of which indicates the distinction between the pure and alloyed. Pliny
  describes it (lib. xxxiii. cap. 43.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Auri argentique mentionem comitatur lapis quem coticulam appellant,
  quondam non solitus inveniri, nisi in flumine Tmolo, ut auctor est
  Theophrastus: nunc vero passim; quem alii Heraclium, alii Lydium vocant.
  His coticulis periti, cum e vena ut lima rapuerint experimentum, protinus
  dicunt quantum auri sit in ea, quantum argenti vel æris, scripulari
  differentia, mirabili ratione, non fallente."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is the substance referred to in the apothegms of Lord Bacon, that
  "gold is tried by the <i>touchstone</i>, and men by gold."</p>

  <p>The French, from the same practice, know the same substance by the
  name of <i>Pierre de touche</i>. The use of the touchstone, at the
  present day, is thus described by Ure in his <i>Dictionary of Arts and
  Mines</i>, under the head of "Assay:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In such small work as cannot be assayed, by scraping off a part and
  cupelling it, the assayers endeavor to ascertain its fineness or quality
  by the touch. This is a method of comparing the colour and other
  properties of a minute portion of the metal, with those of small bars,
  the composition of which is known. These bars are called <i>touch
  needles</i>, and they are rubbed upon a smooth piece of black basaltes,
  or pottery, which <i>for this reason is called the touchstone</i>."</p>

  the editor contents himself with quoting from an article in the
  <i>Quarterly Review</i> (vol. xxxiii. p. 344.), in which the Greek courts
  of justice are treated of.&mdash;'We have all heard of a race of men who
  used, in former days, to ply about our own courts of law, and who, from
  their manner of making known their occupation, were recognized by the
  name of <i>Straw-shoes</i>. An advocate, or lawyer, who wanted a
  <i>convenient</i> witness, knew by these signs where to find one, and the
  colloquy between the parties was brief. 'Don't you remember?' said the
  advocate&mdash;(the party looked at the fee and gave no sign; but the fee
  increased, and the powers of memory increased with it). 'To be sure I
  do.' 'Then come into the court and swear it.' And Straw-shoes went into
  the court and swore it. Athens abounded in Straw-shoes."</p>

  <p><i>Lawyers' Bags</i> (Vol. vii., p. 85.).&mdash;I think the statement

  readers. I had been a barrister several years when that trial took place,
  and cannot think that I had ever seen (indeed that I have yet seen) a
  barrister or a barrister's clerk carrying a green bag. I suspect it is a
  mere blunder arising out of the talk about the "green bag" which was said
  to contain the charges against the Queen. That, however, I apprehend was
  not a lawyer's bag, whatever some lawyers might have to do with it.</p>

  I can confidently assert that I never saw a green bag borne by a
  barrister or solicitor during that time. The only colours that were ever
  paraded in my experience by those legal functionaries, were purple and
  crimson; and they have so continued till the present time&mdash;I will
  not say without interruption, because I have been grieved to see that
  tailors and small London pedlars have invaded the privilege.</p>

  Colonel Noel Barton, who served with distinction under Marlborough, and

  <p>We have, in Sir John Sinclair's statistical account of Scotland, an
  account given of a bell belonging to the old chapel of St. Fillan, in the
  parish of Killin, Perthshire, which usually lay on a gravestone in the
  churchyard. Mad people were brought hither to be dipped in the saint's
  pool; the maniac was then confined all night in the chapel, bound with
  ropes, and in the morning the bell was set on his head with great
  solemnity. This was the Highland cure for mania. It was the popular
  superstition of the district, that this bell would, if stolen, extricate
  itself out of the thief's hands, and return to its original place,
  ringing all the way.</p>

  <p><i>Latin Poem</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 6, 7.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Lord
  Braybrooke</span> does not appear to be so correct as usual in his
  belief, that neither of the two Latin poems, which he quotes, have been
  previously in print. Crowe's beautiful monody will be found at p. 234. of
  his collected poems, published by Murray, 1827. The printed copy,
  however, which is headed</p>

<p class="ac">"Inscriptio in horto Auctoris apud Alton in Com.<br/>
Wilt.<br/>
&mdash;&mdash;<br/>
M. S.<br/>
Gulielmi Crowe,<br/>
Signif. Leg. iv.<br/>
Qui cecidit in acie,<br/>

  <p>has the following differences: line 7., "respexit" for "ascripsit;" l.
  9., "solvo" for "pono." L. 10. and the following lines stand thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Quinetiam assidue hic veniam, lentæque senectæ,</p>

      <p>Sedibus his oro, m&oelig;sti reverere parentis,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and so on to the end, with one or two alterations; except in the
  penultimate line, "sit" for "stet;" and, in the last, "jucundi" for
  "dilecti."</p>

  <p><i>Daubuz</i> (Vol. vi., p. 527.).&mdash;An interesting notice of the
  Rev. Charles Daubuz occurs in Hunter's <i>Hallamshire</i>, p. 175. It is
  unnecessary to quote the whole, and I shall content myself with merely
  observing that if the dates in the <!-- Page 145 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>{145}</span><i>Hallamshire</i> are
  to be depended upon, and I have almost invariably found them correct,
  there is a slight inaccuracy in the note copied from the commentary. Mr.
  Hunter writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He (Daubuz) was a native of Guienne, but at twelve years of age was
  driven from his native country, with his only surviving parent Julia
  Daubuz, by the religious persecution of 1686. In 1689 he was admitted of
  Queen's College, Cambridge, and remained in college till 1696, when he
  accepted the situation of head master of the (Grammar) School of
  Sheffield. He left Sheffield in 1699 on being presented to the Vicarage
  of Brotherton near Ferry-Bridge, where he was much loved and respected.
  He died there on the 14th of June, 1717," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">W. S. (Sheffield.)</p>

  <p>When the Levant Company surrendered their charter to the crown in the
  year 1826, Mr. J. T. Daubuz was treasurer to the Company. He was a highly
  respected merchant in the city of London, and had purchased the estate of
  Offington, near Worthing in Sussex, an estate formerly belonging to the
  Lords De la Warr. Mr. Daubuz still resides at Offington.</p>

  <p><i>The Bride's Seat in Church</i> (Vol. vi., p. 424.).&mdash;One of
  the sermons mentioned in Surtees' note, and inquired after by J. R. M.,
  M.A., was written by William Whately, the learned and celebrated Puritan,
  who was vicar of Banbury in Oxfordshire. It is entitled</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Bride Bush, or a Wedding Sermon, compendiously describing the
  duties of married persons. By performing whereof, marriage shall be to
  them a great helpe, which now find it a little hell. London, 1617. 4to.
  On Eph. v. 23."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I believe a copy of the sermon may be found in the Bodleian Library.
  Two propositions contained in this sermon led to Whately's being convened
  before the High Commission, when he acknowledged that he was unable to
  justify them, and recanted May 4, 1621. (See Wood's <i>Ath. Oxon.</i> by
  Bliss, vol. ii. col. 638.)</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John. I. Dredge.</span></p>

  <p><i>Louis Napoleon, President of France</i> (Vol. vi., p.
  435.).&mdash;Modern history furnishes more than one instance of the
  anomaly adverted to by <span class="sc">Mr. Relton</span>. After the
  murder of Louis XVI., his son, though he never ascended the throne, was
  recognized by the legitimists of the day as Louis XVII.; and on the
  restoration of the family in 1815, the Comte d'Artois assumed the title
  of Louis XVIII. In this way the revolutionary chasm was, as it were,
  bridged over, and the dynasty of the elder Bourbons exhibited on an
  uninterrupted line.</p>

  <p>So it is as regards the Napoleon dynasty. The Duke de Reichstadt,
  Napoleon's son, was in the same predicament as the son of Louis XVI. He
  received from the Bonapartists the title of Napoleon II.; and Louis
  Napoleon therefore becomes Napoleon III.</p>

  <p>A similar case <i>might</i> have occurred to the House of Stuart, if
  the Pretender's son, who began by taking the title of Henry IX., had not
  extinguished the hopes and pretensions of his ill-fated race, by
  exchanging his "crown" for a cardinal's hat. And to-morrow (though that
  is perhaps a little too soon) the same thing may happen again to the
  elder branch of the Bourbons, should the Comte de Chambord (Henry V.)
  leave a son of that name to ascend the throne as Henry VI.</p>

  <p><i>Chapel Plaster</i> (Vol. vii., p. 37.).&mdash;For an explanation of
  the word <i>plaster</i>, on which your correspondent has offered so
  elaborate a commentary, I would beg to refer him to White's
  <i>Selborne</i> (vol. i. p. 5; vol. ii. p. 340., 4to. edit.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the centre of the village, and near the church, is a square piece
  of ground surrounded by houses, and vulgarly called <i>The Plestor</i>.
  In the midst of this spot stood, in old times, a vast oak.... This
  venerable tree, surrounded with stone steps, and seats above them, was
  the delight of old and young, and a place of much resort in summer
  evenings; where the former sat in grave debate, while the latter
  frolicked and danced before them.</p>

  <p>"This <i>Pleystow</i> (Saxon, Plegstow), <i>locus ludorum</i>, or
  play-place, continues still, as in old times, to be the scene of
  recreation for the youths and children of the neighbourhood."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Chapel Plaster</i> is, I believe, an outlying hamlet belonging to
  the parish of Box; and the name imports merely what in Scotland would be
  called "the Kirk on the Green"&mdash;the chapel built on, or near to, the
  playground of the villagers.</p>

  <p>The fascinating volumes above named will afford a reply to an
  unanswered Query in your second volume (Vol. ii., p. 266.), the meaning
  of the local word <i>Hanger</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The high part to the S.W. consists of a vast hill of chalk, rising
  300 feet above the village; and is divided into a sheep down, the high
  wood, and <i>a long hanging wood</i>, called <i>The
  Hanger</i>."&mdash;Vol. i. p. 1.</p>

  <p><i>Passage in Thomson</i> (Vol. vii., p. 67.).&mdash;<i>Steaming</i>
  is clearly the true reading, and means that the exhalations which
  <i>steam</i> from the waters are sent down again in the showers of
  spring. This will appear still clearer by reference to a similar passage
  in Milton's Morning Hymn, which Thomson was evidently copying:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ye mists and exhalations that now rise</p>
      <p>From hill or <i>steaming</i> lake, dusky or grey," &amp;c.</p>

<p><!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>{146}</span></p>

  <p><i>Passage in Locksley Hall</i> (Vol. vii., p. 25.).&mdash;If Tennyson
  really meant his readers to gather from the lines in question, that the
  curlew's <i>call gleams</i> about the moorland, he used a very bold
  figure of speech, yet one not uncommon in the vivid language of Greece.
  For example:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span title="Paian de lampei stonoessa te nêrus homaulos." class="grk"
  >&Pi;&alpha;&iota;&#x1F70;&nu; &delta;&#x1F72; <span
  class="gesperrt">&lambda;&#x1F71;&mu;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;</span>
  &sigma;&tau;&#x1F79;&nu;&omicron;&epsilon;&sigma;&sigma;&#x1F71;
  &tau;&epsilon; &nu;&#x1FC6;&rho;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F45;&mu;&alpha;&upsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;.</span>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And again,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span title="Elampse ... artiôs phaneisa phama." class="grk"><span
  class="gesperrt">&#x1F1C;&lambda;&alpha;&mu;&psi;&epsilon;</span> ...
  &#x1F00;&rho;&tau;&#x1F77;&omega;&sigmaf; <span
  class="gesperrt">&phi;&alpha;&nu;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&sigma;&alpha;</span>
  &phi;&#x1F71;&mu;&alpha;.</span>" (Sophocles.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So also,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span title="Boa prepei." class="grk">&Beta;&omicron;&#x1F70; <span
  class="gesperrt">&pi;&rho;&#x1F73;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;</span>.</span>"
  (Pindar and Æschylus.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>May it not, however, be just possible that Tennyson did not mean
  <i>anything</i>?</p>

  9<i>d.</i> per oz.), prepared by DELATOUCHE &amp; CO., Photographic and

  <p>PHOTOGRAPHY.&mdash;Collodion (Iodized with the Ammonio-Iodide of
  Silver).&mdash;J. B. HOCKIN &amp; CO., Chemists, 289. Strand, were the
  first in England who published the application of this agent (see
  <i>Athenæum</i>, Aug. 14th). Their Collodion (price 9<i>d.</i> per oz.)
  retains its extraordinary sensitiveness, tenacity, and colour unimpaired
  for months: it may be exported to any climate, and the Iodizing Compound
  mixed as required. J. B. HOCKIN &amp; CO. manufacture PURE CHEMICALS and
  all APPARATUS with the latest Improvements adapted for all the
  Photographic and Daguerreotype processes. Cameras for Developing in the
  open Country. GLASS BATHS adapted to any Camera. Lenses from the best

  <p>PHOTOGRAPHY.&mdash;XYLO-IODIDE OF SILVER, prepared solely by R. W.
  THOMAS, has now obtained an European fame; it supersedes the use of all
  other preparations of Collodion. Witness the subjoined Testimonial.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p class="author">"122. Regent Street</p>

  <p>"Dear Sir,&mdash;In answer to your inquiry of this morning, I have no
  hesitation in saying that your preparation of Collodion is incomparably
  better and more sensitive than all the advertised Collodio-Iodides,
  which, for my professional purposes, are quite useless when compared to
  yours.</p>

  <p>MR. R. W. THOMAS begs most earnestly to caution photographers against
  purchasing impure chemicals, which are now too frequently sold at very
  low prices. It is to this cause nearly always that their labours are
  unattended with success.</p>

  <p>Chemicals of absolute purity, especially prepared for this art, may be
  obtained from R. W. THOMAS, Chemist and Professor of Photography, 10.
  Pall Mall.</p>

  <p>N.B.&mdash;The name of Mr. T.'s preparation, Xylo-Iodide of Silver, is
  made use of by unprincipled persons. To prevent imposition each bottle is
  stamped with a red label bearing the maker's signature.</p>

  invented and brought to the greatest perfection the following leading
  articles, besides numerous others:&mdash;Their Ventilating Natural Curl;
  Ladies and Gentlemen's PERUKES, either Crops or Full Dress, with Partings
  and Crowns so natural as to defy detection, and with or without their
  improved Metallic Springs; Ventilating Fronts, Bandeaux, Borders, Nattes,
  Bands à la Reine, &amp;c.; also their instantaneous Liquid Hair Dye, the
  only dye that really answers for all colours, and never fades nor
  acquires that unnatural red or purple tint common to all other dyes; it
  is permanent, free of any smell, and perfectly harmless. Any lady or
  gentleman, sceptical of its effects in dyeing any shade of colour, can
  have it applied, free of any charge, at KERR &amp; STRANG'S, 124.
